# gw_pta_emulator
A notebook and data associated with the paper Taylor, Simon, Sampson (2016). 

Users can read in GW characteristic strain spectra from black-hole population simulations, re-bin for their own observing baseline, and construct new spectra. The notebook then allows the user to train a Gaussian process to emulate the spectral behavior at all frequencies across the astrophysical parameter space of supermassive black-hole binary environments.
